# JAVASCRIPT FORM VALIDATION
 This is a small Project about javascript form validation with the help of HTML CSS


## Client-side form validation
Before submitting data to the server, it is important to ensure all required form controls are filled out, 
in the correct format. This is called client-side form validation, and 
helps ensure data submitted matches the requirements set forth in the various form controls. 
This article leads you through basic concepts and examples of client-side form validation.

**Prerequisites**:	Computer literacy, a reasonable understanding of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**
**Objective**:	To understand what client-side form validation is, why it's important, and how to apply various techniques to implement it.

# Different types of client-side validation

**1.Built-in form validation** uses HTML5 form validation features, 
which we've discussed in many places throughout this module. 
This validation generally doesn't require much JavaScript. 
Built-in form validation has better performance than JavaScript, 
but it is not as customizable as JavaScript validation.

**2.JavaScript** validation is coded using JavaScript. This validation is completely 
customizable, but you need to create it all (or use a library).
